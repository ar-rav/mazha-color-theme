                    <!--Verdana is a readable sans serif typeface that can be found all over the World Wide Web. It was designed with onscreen reading in mind. 
                    Verdana’s no-nonsense look and clear letter shapes make it a good typeface for body text, especially at small sizes, where its large lowercase letters with ample spacing between them make it easy to read. 
                    Verdana is a good choice for presentations and web pages, as well as for flyers, brochures, correspondence, and reports. Try combining Verdana for body text with Tahoma for headlines.-->

                    <!--Amarna is a semi-glyphic humanist sans-serif typeface, taking inspiration from the cold sophistication of early humanist sans- and glyphic serifs such as Gill Sans or Albertus, 
                    while attempting to bring the traits which define those typefaces in line with the principles of modern sans-serif type design. Amarna is amicable and easy to read in small sizes, 
                    but takes on a much more glyphic, naturalistic quality when rendered in larger sizes, at lighter weights and especially in all-caps text.-->

Suitable for both headings and body text, especially in larger sizes.</li>

                    <!--The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. 
                    As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! 
                    These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.-->

It captures the essence of early twentieth-century natural design and is available under a libre license. Ideal for headlines and display text.</li>
